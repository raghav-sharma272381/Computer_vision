# Deep Learning computer vision application to differenciate between different types of daals ( lentils ) 

This Deep learning application uses resnet50 model and then fine tunes it according to custom data resulting in accuracy of around 92%, you can use it here : -

for some reason the files are not visible on this repository you can view all the files from huggingface, the fine tuned model is also openly availaible feel free to tinker with it.

the idea of this project was more of a joke but it turned out after fine tuning the model, cleaning and transforming the dataset it is fairly accurate (92%)
